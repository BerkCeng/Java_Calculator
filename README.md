I have developed a calculator that accommodates input of as many numbers as desired for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Upon attempting to divide a number by zero, the calculator promptly issues an error message, indicating the impossibility of executing the operation. This implementation ensures the calculator's adherence to mathematical principles and promotes the delivery of accurate computational results, reflecting a commitment to user-centric design principles.
